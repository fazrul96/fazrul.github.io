## Welcome to my Eclipse Development Projects

During my time at university, I had the opportunity to work on several Eclipse projects that allowed me to enhance my software development skills. Here are a few projects I completed:

Repositories (Public) : [Eclipse Projects](https://github.com/fazrul96/EclipseProjects)

### Puzzle Game

The Puzzle Game is an interactive and challenging game where players solve various puzzles to progress through different levels. It involves logic, problem-solving, and strategic thinking. I developed this game using Eclipse, incorporating features such as puzzle generation, user interface design, and game mechanics implementation.

### Chatbot Application

The Chatbot Application is an intelligent software program designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. It utilizes natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand user queries and provide relevant responses. I developed this application in Eclipse, leveraging frameworks and libraries to build a responsive and interactive chatbot.

### Tower Defense Game

The Tower Defense Game is a popular strategy game where players defend their territory by strategically placing defensive towers to stop enemy units from reaching their objective. I developed this game using Eclipse, implementing features such as tower selection, enemy AI, wave management, and visual effects.

These Eclipse projects allowed me to apply my programming knowledge and gain hands-on experience in software development. They showcase my ability to design and implement functional and engaging applications.

If you have any questions or would like to know more about these projects, please feel free to reach out to me.
